# ais-shipnoise

Fetches current AIS positions of Salish Sea whale watch boats from [AISHub](https://www.aishub.net/) and plots them on an OpenStreetMap basemap.

Live map: https://orcasound.github.io/ais-shipnoise/ (rebuilt every ~30 min by GitHub Actions).

## Local use

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # then put your AISHub username in .env
python fetch_ww_boats_and_plot.py              # writes boats_map_<timestamp>.png
python fetch_ww_boats_and_plot.py --output x.png
```

Boats to track are listed in `whale_watch_boats.txt`.

## Credentials

The AISHub username is read from the `AISHUB_USERNAME` environment variable (or a local `.env`, which is gitignored). In GitHub Actions it comes from the repository secret `AISHUB_USERNAME`. Never commit it.
